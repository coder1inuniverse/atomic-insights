## Key Takeaways

- A reactor trip occurred due to personnel error during testing of neutron detector channels.
- Root causes include inattention to detail by the technician and inadequate procedural safeguards.
- The incident underscores the importance of accurate procedures and thorough supervision in nuclear safety.
- Implementing improved procedures and supervision can prevent similar events.

## The Incident: A Timeline of Events

On May 31, 1986, at approximately 10:26 AM, a reactor trip occurred at a nuclear power plant. The reactor was operating at 100% power when the trip was initiated due to personnel error during operational testing of the power range neutron detector channels.

During a routine test of power range channel N-42, a technician inadvertently continued the test on channel N-41, which caused the reactor to trip as the protection system detected a false condition.


## What Was Missed?

The reactor trip led to several critical issues:

1. **Damage to the Condensate System**: A water hammer event caused by a transient in the condensate system resulted in damage, delaying reactor restart.
2. **Unmonitored Release**: Steam release through secondary power operated relief valves (PORVs) due to steam generator tube leakage led to an unmonitored release to the atmosphere.

## Root Causes: Unraveling the Incident

The investigation revealed two primary causes:

1. **Personnel Error**: The technician failed to follow the correct procedure, resulting in the reactor trip.
2. **Inadequate Labeling and Procedures**: Insufficient labeling of instrument drawers and inadequate test procedures contributed to the error.

## Assessing the Impact: Was Safety Compromised?

Upon the reactor trip, the plant's response was normal, with all safety systems functioning as designed. However, subsequent issues included:

- **Condensate System Damage**: The water hammer event caused significant damage.
- **Unmonitored Release**: The release to the atmosphere, though a small fraction of allowable limits, highlighted procedural weaknesses.

## Corrective Actions: Strengthening Procedures and Supervision

In response to this incident, the plant implemented several key measures:

1. **Counseling and Training**: Personnel involved were counseled and assigned to develop and present "Lessons Learned" training seminars.
2. **Improved Labeling**: Instrument drawers were re-labeled to reduce confusion.
3. **Human Factors Review**: The test procedure underwent a human factors review to improve usability and reduce error potential.
4. **Engineering Modifications**: Modifications to the condensate system were made to prevent future water hammer events.

## Key Lessons for Nuclear Operations

This incident offers valuable insights for the nuclear industry:

1. **Attention to Detail**: Even minor procedural lapses can have significant consequences.
2. **Thorough Supervision**: Effective supervision and review processes are essential for catching and correcting errors.
3. **Procedural Improvements**: Regular evaluation and improvement of procedures can help prevent future incidents.
4. **Team Involvement**: Engaging personnel in developing corrective actions strengthens the overall safety culture.

## Conclusion: Vigilance in Every Detail

While this incident did not result in immediate safety concerns, it serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of meticulous attention to detail in nuclear operations. From the operators recording data to the supervisors reviewing logs, every role plays a crucial part in maintaining the highest standards of safety.

As we reflect on this event, let's remember that in nuclear safety, there are no small oversights. Every log entry, every review, and every procedure contributes to the overall safety of the plant and the surrounding community. By learning from incidents like this and continuously improving our processes, we can work towards a future of enhanced nuclear safety and reliability.
