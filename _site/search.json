    "text": "The Incident: A Timeline of Events\nOn February 7, 1995, during the performance of a surveillance procedure at A Plant, a personnel error led to the loss of the “A” Emergency Safeguards (ES) bus. The reactor was operating at 100% power, generating 879 megawatts at the time of the incident.\nThe error occurred when a technician failed to position a “Trip Block” switch correctly. When the test pushbutton was pressed, an undervoltage condition was sensed, triggering an Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) Loss of Power Start signal. This caused the “A” ES bus to strip and lock out the supply breakers. Fortunately, the associated EDG did not start since it was taken out of service for the surveillance."

    "text": "The Incident: A Timeline of Events\nOn May 31, 1986, at approximately 10:26 AM, a reactor trip occurred at a nuclear power plant. The reactor was operating at 100% power when the trip was initiated due to personnel error during operational testing of the power range neutron detector channels.\nDuring a routine test of power range channel N-42, a technician inadvertently continued the test on channel N-41, which caused the reactor to trip as the protection system detected a false condition."

    "section": "What Was Missed?",
    "text": "What Was Missed?\nThe reactor trip led to several critical issues:\n\nDamage to the Condensate System: A water hammer event caused by a transient in the condensate system resulted in damage, delaying reactor restart.\nUnmonitored Release: Steam release through secondary power operated relief valves (PORVs) due to steam generator tube leakage led to an unmonitored release to the atmosphere."
