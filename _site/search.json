During a routine monthly test, a safety pump suddenly activated, catching the control room team off guard. How did this happen, and what can we learn from it?\n[IMAGE 1: Control Room Illustration]\nImage prompt: Create a digital illustration of a modern nuclear power plant control room. Show multiple control panels with buttons, switches, and monitors. Include 2-3 operators in protective gear working at different stations. Use a cool color palette with blue and green hues to convey a sense of technology and safety."

An operator placed the wrong switch in the “off” position. Specifically:\n\nCorrect Action: Turn off the HPI AUTO TEST GRP 3 switch\nActual Action: Turned off the “A” HPI AUTO TEST SELECT switch\n\nThis seemingly small error was enough to trigger the unexpected pump activation."
