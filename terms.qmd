Glossary
A
Automatic Actuation Logic
A system designed to initiate safety-related equipment operation without human intervention when specific conditions are met.

C
Cold Shutdown (MODE 5)
A reactor operational mode where the coolant temperature is below 200°F (93°C) and the reactor is subcritical.

D
Decay Heat
The heat produced by the radioactive decay of fission products after a nuclear reactor has been shut down.

Decay Heat Closed Cycle Cooling Water Pump
A pump that circulates cooling water to remove decay heat from a shutdown reactor.

H
HPI (High Pressure Injection)
An emergency core cooling system that injects coolant into the reactor vessel under high pressure conditions.

N
Nuclear Power Plant
A thermal power station that uses controlled nuclear fission to generate electricity.

O
Operator
A trained professional responsible for monitoring and controlling nuclear reactor operations.

R
Refueling Outage
A planned period during which a nuclear reactor is shut down for refueling and maintenance activities.

S
Safety Culture
The core values and behaviors resulting from a collective commitment to emphasize safety over competing goals.

Safety Pump
A pump that is part of a nuclear power plant's safety systems, designed to provide cooling in emergency situations.

Self-checking
A human performance tool used to focus an individual's attention on the task at hand before taking action.

STAR (Stop, Think, Act, Review)
A self-check process used in nuclear operations to reduce human error.

Surveillance Procedure
A set of instructions for performing tests to verify the operability of safety-related equipment.
